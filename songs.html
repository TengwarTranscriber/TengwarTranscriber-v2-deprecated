      <h1>Song of Durin</h1>
        <p>The world was young, the mountains green,<br/>
No stain yet on the Moon was seen,<br/>
No words were laid on stream or stone<br/>
When Durin woke and walked alone.<br/>
He named the nameless hills and dells;<br/>
He drank from yet untasted wells;<br/>
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,<br/>
And saw a crown of stars appear,<br/>
As gems upon a silver thread,<br/>
Above the shadows of his head.<br/><br/>
The world was fair, the mountains tall,<br/>
In Elder Days before the fall<br/>
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond<br/>
And Gondolin, who now beyond<br/>
The Western Seas have passed away:<br/>
The world was fair in Durin's Day.<br/><br/>
A king he was on carven throne<br/>
In many-pillared halls of stone<br/>
With golden roof and silver floor,<br/>
And runes of power upon the door.<br/>
The light of sun and star and moon<br/>
In shining lamps of crystal hewn<br/>
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night<br/>
There shone for ever fair and bright.<br/><br/>
There hammer on the anvil smote<br/>
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;<br/>
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;<br/>
The delver mined, the mason built.<br/>
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,<br/>
And metal wrought like fishes' mail,<br/>
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,<br/>
And shining spears were laid in hoard.<br/><br/>
Unwearied then were Durin's folk;<br/>
Beneath the mountains music woke:<br/>
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,<br/>
And at the gates the trumpets rang.<br/><br/>
The world is grey, the mountains old,<br/>
The forge's fire is ashen-cold;<br/>
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:<br/>
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls;<br/>
The shadow lies upon his tomb<br/>
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.<br/>
But still the sunken stars appear<br/>
In dark and windless Mirrormere;<br/>
There lies his crown in water deep,<br/>
Till Durin wakes again from sleep.<br/>
      </p>
      <h1>Song of the Lonely Mountain</h1>
        <p>
Far over the misty mountains cold<br/>
To dungeons deep and caverns old<br/>
We must away ere break of day<br/>
To seek the pale enchanted gold.<br/>
<br/>
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br/>
While hammers fell like ringing bells<br/>
In places deep, where dark things sleep,<br/>
In hollow halls beneath the fells.<br/>
<br/>
For ancient king and elvish lord<br/>
There many a gleaming golden hoard<br/>
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught<br/>
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.<br/>
<br/>
On silver necklaces they strung<br/>
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung<br/>
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire<br/>
They meshed the light of moon and sun.<br/>
<br/>
Far over the misty mountains cold<br/>
To dungeons deep and caverns old<br/>
We must away, ere break of day,<br/>
To claim our long-forgotten gold.<br/>
<br/>
Goblets they carved there for themselves<br/>
And harps of gold; where no man delves<br/>
There lay they long, and many a song<br/>
Was sung unheard by men or elves.<br/>
<br/>
The pines were roaring on the height,<br/>
The winds were moaning in the night.<br/>
The fire was red, it flaming spread;<br/>
The trees like torches blazed with light.<br/>
<br/>
The bells were ringing in the dale<br/>
And men they looked up with faces pale;<br/>
The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire<br/>
Laid low their towers and houses frail.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain smoked beneath the moon;<br/>
The dwarves they heard the tramp of doom.<br/>
They fled their hall to dying fall<br/>
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.<br/>
<br/>
Far over the misty mountains grim<br/>
To dungeons deep and caverns dim<br/>
We must away, ere break of day,<br/>
To win our harps and gold from him!<br/>
<br/>
The wind was on the withered heath,<br/>
but in the forest stirred no leaf:<br/>
there shadows lay be night or day,<br/>
and dark things silent crept beneath.<br/>
The wind came down from mountains cold,<br/>
and like a tide it roared and rolled;<br/>
the branches groaned, the forest moaned,<br/>
and leaves were laid upon the mould.<br/>
<br/>
The wind went on from West to East;<br/>
all movement in the forest ceased,<br/>
but shrill and harsh across the marsh<br/>
its whistling voices were released.<br/>
<br/>
The grasses hissed, their tassels bent,<br/>
the reeds were rattling--on it went<br/>
o'er shaken pool under heavens cool<br/>
where racing clouds were torn and rent.<br/>
<br/>
It passed the Lonely Mountain bare<br/>
and swept above the dragon's lair:<br/>
there black and dark lay boulders stark<br/>
and flying smoke was in the air.<br/>
<br/>
It left the world and took its flight<br/>
over the wide seas of the night.<br/>
The moon set sail upon the gale,<br/>
and stars were fanned to leaping light.<br/>
<br/>
Under the Mountain dark and tall<br/>
The King has come unto his hall!<br/>
His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,<br/>
And ever so his foes shall fall.<br/>
The sword is sharp, the spear is long,<br/>
The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;<br/>
The heart is bold that looks on gold;<br/>
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br/>
While hammers fell like ringing bells<br/>
In places deep, where dark things sleep,<br/>
In hollow halls beneath the fells.<br/>
<br/>
On silver necklaces they strung<br/>
The light of stars, on crowns they hung<br/>
The dragon-fire, from twisted wire<br/>
The melody of harps they wrung.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain throne once more is freed!<br/>
O! wandering folk, the summons heed!<br/>
Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!<br/>
The king of friend and kin has need.<br/>
<br/>
Now call we over the mountains cold,<br/>
‘Come back unto the caverns old’!<br/>
Here at the Gates the king awaits,<br/>
His hands are rich with gems and gold.<br/>
<br/>
The king is come unto his hall<br/>
Under the Mountain dark and tall.<br/>
The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,<br/>
And ever so our foes shall fall!
