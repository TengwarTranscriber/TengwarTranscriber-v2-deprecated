      <div class="floatleft" style="line-height: 200%;">
        <p>The world was young, the mountains green,<br/>
No stain yet on the Moon was seen,<br/>
No words were laid on stream or stone<br/>
When Durin woke and walked alone.<br/>
He named the nameless hills and dells;<br/>
He drank from yet untasted wells;<br/>
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,<br/>
And saw a crown of stars appear,<br/>
As gems upon a silver thread,<br/>
Above the shadows of his head.<br/><br/>
The world was fair, the mountains tall,<br/>
In Elder Days before the fall<br/>
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond<br/>
And Gondolin, who now beyond<br/>
The Western Seas have passed away:<br/>
The world was fair in Durin's Day.<br/><br/>
A king he was on carven throne<br/>
In many-pillared halls of stone<br/>
With golden roof and silver floor,<br/>
And runes of power upon the door.<br/>
The light of sun and star and moon<br/>
In shining lamps of crystal hewn<br/>
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night<br/>
There shone for ever fair and bright.<br/><br/>
There hammer on the anvil smote,<br/>
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;<br/>
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;<br/>
The delver mined, the mason built.<br/>
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,<br/>
And metal wrought like fishes' mail,<br/>
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,<br/>
And shining spears were laid in hoard.<br/><br/>
Unwearied then were Durin's folk;<br/>
Beneath the mountains music woke:<br/>
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,<br/>
And at the gates the trumpets rang.<br/><br/>
The world is grey, the mountains old,<br/>
The forge's fire is ashen-cold;<br/>
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:<br/>
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls;<br/>
The shadow lies upon his tomb<br/>
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.<br/>
But still the sunken stars appear<br/>
In dark and windless Mirrormere;<br/>
There lies his crown in water deep,<br/>
Till Durin wakes again from sleep.</p>
